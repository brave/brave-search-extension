# Test Build Workflow
#
# This workflow validates the extension code quality and build process on pull requests.
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Sets up the development environment (Node.js 22.x)
# 2. Installs project dependencies
# 3. Runs code quality checks (linting and testing)
# 4. Tests the build process to ensure packages can be created
# 5. Verifies that build artifacts are generated correctly
# 6. Uploads the built extension packages as artifacts for review
#
# Triggered on: Manual dispatch and pull requests to main/master branches
